# Employee_Tracker

This project was undertaken to create a command-line application that allows the user to do the following:
* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles 
Utilizing SQL and Node.js allows the database to be accessed via command-line actions. 


## How to Use
When opening your terminal you are prompted with options structred via inquirer. You are able to complete the above actions and retrieve, update, or view different aspects of any given employee in the system.

 ## Future Applications
In theory this application could be linked to more sophisticated employee management system. If combined with front-end, this application could be used for a total in-house employee tracking system for HR.
